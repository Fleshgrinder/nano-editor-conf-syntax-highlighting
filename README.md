nano-editor-conf-syntax-highlighting
====================================

nano editor catch all syntax-highlighting for configuration files.
Also included is the global nanorc file I use on my systems.

Copy `nanorc` to your `/etc` directory (override the default file).

Copy `conf.nanorc` to your `/usr/share/nano` directory.
